`browser.py` launches a single Chromium with a dedicated profile and remote
debugging (Chrome DevTools Protocol, CDP) on a fixed port. You authenticate **once**;
the session persists in the profile across restarts. Anything that speaks CDP —
Playwright, an MCP server, this script's own subcommands — then attaches to that
same logged-in browser. No tool re-implements authentication.

It is the shared **login provider** that other repos depend on instead of each
shipping its own brittle auth flow.

---

## Why

- **Log in once, reuse everywhere.** A persistent profile means one SSO/2FA dance,
  then every consumer (an AI agent's browser tools, a billing scraper, a token
  refresher) rides the same session.
- **Two clients, one browser.** Playwright MCP (native browser tools for an agent)
  and `browser.py`'s shell subcommands both attach over CDP to the *same* Chromium.
- **Credentials never get re-typed or embedded.** Secrets live in the macOS
  keychain (or 1Password); this repo holds **none**. Magic-link tokens are handled
  in memory only.

## Requirements

| Tool                    | For                                              | Required? |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :-------- |
| macOS                   | uses the `security` keychain binary; profile paths | yes (today) |
| Python ≥ 3.10 + `uv`    | runtime (`uv` auto-creates the venv on first run) | yes       |
| Playwright + Chromium   | the browser itself (`playwright install chromium`) | yes       |
| `himalaya`              | full-auto claude.ai magic-link login (reads the email) | optional |
| `op` (1Password CLI)    | CSCS credential fallback before the keychain is set up | optional |

`playwright`, `pyotp`, and `requests` are declared in `pyproject.toml`. You don't
have to install them yourself: on first run `browser.py` **self-bootstraps** an
isolated venv at `~/.cache/claude-browser/venv` via `uv` and re-execs into it.

## Install

```commands
git clone https://github.com/glensk/browser-login.git
cd browser-login

# put browser.py on your PATH (pick one):
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"        # add to ~/.zshrc to make it permanent
#   …or symlink:  ln -s "$PWD/bin/browser.py" ~/.local/bin/browser.py

# one-time: fetch the Chromium build Playwright drives
uv run playwright install chromium   # (first `browser.py up` will prompt if missing)
```

That's it — `browser.py` creates its own venv on first use.

## Quick start

```commands
browser.py up                 # launch the shared Chromium (idempotent)
browser.py status             # CDP health, browser version, open tabs
browser.py open https://…     # navigate a tab
browser.py eval 'document.title' [--url SUBSTR]   # run JS in the active/matched tab → JSON
browser.py down               # quit the shared browser
```

## Multi-site login

A **site** is one entry in the `SITES` registry inside `browser.py`. Generic
subcommands dispatch through it:

```commands
browser.py login SITE         # ensure logged in (automated or assisted)
browser.py logged-in SITE     # exit 0 if logged in, 2 if not (no login attempted)
browser.py login-log [SITE]   # how often a *real* login was needed (no SITE = all tools)
browser.py store-creds SITE   # save credentials in the macOS keychain (cscs-style)
browser.py forget-creds SITE  # delete them
```

Two sites also expose a **credential-print** command for their consumer (bearer creds
→ stdout only, never logged): `browser.py token` (CSCS Waldur DRF token, also cached
0600) and `browser.py slack-session` (Slack `{token,cookie,team_domain}` JSON; not
cached — xoxc rotates).

Every time a site performs a **real (cold) login** — not a warm "already logged in"
— one record is appended to `~/.cache/claude-browser/login-log/<site>.jsonl` (with a
`mode`: `assisted` = you had to act, vs `auto`/`keychain`/… automated). Read it with
`browser.py login-log` — **no arg = a live aggregate across every tool** (total real
logins, how many you had to sign in for, per-site breakdown, recent events); add a
SITE for just one. That's how you measure how often re-auth — and specifically a
manual sign-in — actually happens.

### Bundled sites

| Site                   | Login style                                                           |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `anthropic` (`claude`) | **Magic-link, fully automatic** when `ANTHROPIC_LOGIN_EMAIL` is set and `himalaya` reads that mailbox: triggers the email, extracts the `claude.ai/magic-link#<token>` URL, opens it. Otherwise **assisted** (you finish the email login once). |
| `cscs`                 | **Keycloak, unattended.** `store-creds cscs` caches username/password/TOTP-seed in the macOS keychain (from 1Password, one last Touch ID); thereafter login runs with no fingerprint. TOTP codes are generated locally with `pyotp`. |
| `openai` (`chatgpt`)   | **Assisted.** ChatGPT Business logs in via Google SSO + 2FA, which can't be replayed from a stored secret — you complete the SSO once in the shared window; the session persists. Logged-in sentinel: the 'Invite member' button on `chatgpt.com/admin/members`. |
| `slack`                | **Assisted.** app.slack.com logs in via email-code / SSO; you sign in once and the session persists. Logged-in sentinel: a team with an `xoxc-` token in `localConfig_v2`. `browser.py slack-session` then prints `{token,cookie,team_domain}` (xoxc + httpOnly `d` cookie via CDP) so `slack-api` can call `users.admin.setInactive` on the Pro plan — where the API token is scope-blocked. Bearer creds → stdout only, never cached. |

CSCS back-compat aliases (`token`, `cscs-login`, `cscs-store-creds`,
`cscs-forget-creds`) are kept because downstream tools depend on their exact stdout
markers and exit codes.

## How other tools consume it

Consumers never re-implement auth — they shell out and react to the exit code:

```python
subprocess.run(["browser.py", "up"], check=False)
rc = subprocess.run(["browser.py", "login", "anthropic"], check=False).returncode
```

Resolution is **PATH-first**: with `bin/` on `$PATH`, `browser.py` is callable from
anywhere. Tools that use the external-dependency convention resolve it as
`command="browser.py"` (PATH) → a conventional sibling clone → the `BROWSER_PY_BIN`
override. So a colleague who has it on `$PATH` needs zero config.

Current consumers: a CSCS portal client (token auto-refresh + re-login), an
Anthropic admin tool (claude.ai login for roster auto-export + invoice download),
and a ChatGPT Business roster scraper (chatgpt.com admin login).

## Adding a new site

Two shapes cover almost everything:

- **Credential-based, unattended** (like CSCS): a scriptable username/password (+TOTP)
  form. Store secrets via `store-creds`, fill at login, optionally extract a token.
- **Assisted / magic-link** (like claude.ai): can't be scripted from a stored secret —
  let the user complete it once, or automate end-to-end if a login email is readable.

Steps: write `cmd_<site>_login(port)` and `cmd_<site>_logged_in(port)` (check a DOM
sentinel on a stable post-login surface — never "the URL isn't `/login`"), optionally
`cmd_<site>_store_creds()`, then register a `Site(...)` in `_sites()`. Reuse the
keychain helpers (`_keychain_get/set`, `_totp_now`, `_op_creds`) and, for email flows,
the `himalaya` helpers. The CDP endpoint is always `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (never
`localhost` — Chrome's debug port is IPv4-only and `localhost`→`::1` stalls on macOS).

## Security

- **No secrets in this repo.** Verified with `gitleaks`; a pre-commit hook
  (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) scans every commit. Configuration is by env var and
  keychain label only.
- **Magic links / tokens are bearer credentials** — kept in memory, never printed,
  logged, or committed.
- **Keychain note:** caching a password + TOTP seed in the login keychain collapses
  2FA to 1FA *on this machine*. FileVault + the keychain protect it at rest, not from
  code running as you. This is an explicit, documented trade-off for unattended login.
